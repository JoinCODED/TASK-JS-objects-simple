## JSON

`JSON` stands for `JavaScript Object Notation`

The `JSON` format is syntactically similar to JavaScript objects, thats what makes it easily converted into JavaScript objects. And since the format is text only, `JSON` data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.

But the diffrence between `JSON` and plain javascript object is that the `keys` must be a `string` written with `double` quotes, while in JavaScript, a key can be `strings`, `numbers`, or identifier names, and the strings can be written in `single` or `double` quotes.

Here is an example of a `JSON` object and a javascript object:

Javascript:

```js
{
name: "Omar",
age: 25
}
```

JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "Omar",
  "age": 25
}
```

You can learn more about `JSON` [Here]("https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON").
